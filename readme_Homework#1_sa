Notes From Sergio Aguilar
Sep 29   task completed
    1- Create a partition in a windows 10
    2- Install Ubuntu 18.04
    Issues: Unable to install Ubuntu alongside... (windows 10) 
    Solution: The computer use to have windows 7 when I migrated to windows 10, 
             I forgot to change the partition from MBR to GUID; so, I ending 
             with windows 10 in a legacy BIOS and during the installation 
             Ubuntu does not recognize the windows 10 Operating Sysytem and 
             it does not give me the option of "install Ubuntu alongsideâ€¦". 
             Therefore, I have migrate partition to GUID, change the BIOS to UEFI
             and now Install a Ubuntu. Finally in same latop I have windows 10 
             and Ubuntu 18.04.
